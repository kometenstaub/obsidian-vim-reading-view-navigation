# Obsidian Vim Yank Highlighter

## Known limitations

The highlight timeout only works if the cursor is moved after it, otherwise it stays highlighted.

The plugin can be installed manually or via BRAT. It is not in the community plugins.

## Credits

This plugin uses monkey-around code from @pjeby, which is ISC-licensed.
